RFE Sweep Data
==============

This is the data for a single sweep of the spectrum (I think).

Get The Peak
------------

The first example given by the code uses the *Peak Step* to print out some information. The *Peak Step* is the frequency that had the largest amplitude for that sweep. The ``GetPeakStep`` will return the index (step) that matches the peak which you can then use to make some queries.

   RFESweepData.GetPeakStep
   RFESweepData.GetAmplitude_DBM
   RFESweepData.GetFrequencyMHZ

.. code::

   peak_step = sweep_data.GetPeakStep()
   peak_amplitude = sweep_data.GetAmplitude_DBM(peak_step)
   peak_frequency = sweep_data.GetFrequencyMHZ(peak_step)
