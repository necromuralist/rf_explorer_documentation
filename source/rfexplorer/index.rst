Modules

RFExplorer
~~~~~~~~~~

These are the main modules used in the example, so I assume they are the only ones that you would use directly.

   :toctree: autogenerated_api

   RFExplorer
   RFESweepData
   RFESweepDataCollection

The Others
~~~~~~~~~~

These aren't used directly in the examples, so I don't think you need to worry about them, but I haven't looked at them so I'm not positive about that, and I suppose it's always better to be complete.

   :toctree: autogenerated_api

   ReceiveSerialThread
   RFE6GEN_CalibrationData
   RFEAmplitudeTableData
   RFE_Common
   RFEConfiguration
