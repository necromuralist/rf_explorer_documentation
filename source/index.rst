RF-Explorer
===========

This is a documentation project for the RF-Explorer for python code. The actual RF Explorer code is `on github <https://github.com/RFExplorer/RFExplorer-for-Python>`_ and they do have some documentation, but I thought that I'd re-document things as I try to learn how to use it.
